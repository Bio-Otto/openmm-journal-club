    "# OpenMM - An Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a practical introduction to the molecular dynamics (MD) engine OpenMM and was prepared for a journal club presentation at the [Structural Bioinformatics and Computational Biochemistry Unit](http://sbcb.bioch.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford. It is inspired by [OpenMM 7: Rapid development of high performance algorithms for molecular dynamics](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005659), the paper introducing the latest version of OpenMM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OpenMM - Who is it for?\n",
    "\n",
    "We already have AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS, and NAMD (not to mention Expresso, Desmond, LAMMPS, Tinker, and many others), so why do we need yet another MD engine?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is: flexibility! OpenMM provides its users with an unrecedented level of control over their simulations, starting from the ability to write custom simulation scripts in Python to the capability of defining novel forces and even integrators. At the same time, it provides competetive performance by implementing kernels to run simulations on GPU hardware - without requiring the user to write CUDA or even C++ code. These features together make OpenMM a powerful research tool for the molecular simulation community.\n",
    "\n",
    "### And who should stay away?\n",
    "\n",
    "There is only one real shortcoming of OpenMM: It does not support MPI parallelism. So if you plan on simulating very large systems that would benefit from scaling to hundrets or thousands of cores, OpenMM might not be the best choice. Similarly, if the hardware you have available does not come with GPUs, you will be limited to a handful of threads and will not see competetive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to keep in mind is that OpenMM's flexibility comes at the cost of an increased ramp up time. Writing a robust simulation script for productive use takes some time even for experienced Python programmers. If all you want to do is run a simple MD simulation, you might achieve that goal faster by using a tool like GROMACS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing OpenMM\n",
    "\n",
    "By far the easiest way of installing OpenMM is through the `conda` package manager of Anaconda Python. This requires no compilation from source, needs no root rights, and takes care of all dependencies except for CUDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of OpenMM 7.3, `conda` packages compatible with all CUDA versions back to 7.5 are available from the [Anaconda Cloud](https://anaconda.org/omnia/openmm). All you need to do is specify the right label when selecting the installation channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of how you would install it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# create a new conda environment for OpenMM:\n",
    "conda create -n openmm-7-3-0-cuda90 python=3.7\n",
    "\n",
    "# activate the newly created environment:\n",
    "source activate openmm-7-3-0-cuda90\n",
    "\n",
    "# install FFT library from omnia channel:\n",
    "# (needs to be installed separately because of channel conflicts)\n",
    "conda install -c omnia fftw3f\n",
    "\n",
    "# install openmm with appropriate CUDA labal:\n",
    "# (CUDA needs to be installed on the system to run simulations on the GPU)\n",
    "conda install -c omnia/label/cuda90 openmm=7.3.0\n",
    "\n",
    "# also install IPython in this environment:\n",
    "# (provides a neater interactive python shell)\n",
    "conda install ipython\n",
    "\n",
    "# to use this environment as kernel in a Jupyter notebook:\n",
    "conda install ipykernel\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed, the installation can be tested via:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m simtk.testInstallation\n",
    "```\n",
    "OpenMM can now be imported into a Python script like any other Python module.\n"

    "## Running a Simple Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "To run simulations with OpenMM, you need to write a Python script. In this script, you load a starting configuration and force field data and specify the algorithms used to carry out the simulation. The script can then be executed like any other Python script - including from a Jupyter notebook as in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below illustrates this on [DHFR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrofolate_reductase) in explicit solvent, using the AMBER99SB-ILDN force field and TIP3P water model."

    "Custom forces are a unique feature of OpenMM which makes it possible to define new interactions on top of the ones defined by the force field. All you need to do is provide an expression for the contribution of the force to the internal energy of the simulation system. OpenMM will then calculate the energy derivatves (i.e. forces) via automatic differentiation and translate them into machine code for execuation. This works on both the CPU and the GPU, so even though custom forces are specified in Python, they can be as fast as the standard forces implemented in OpenMM's C++ core.\n",
